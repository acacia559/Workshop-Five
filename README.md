# Workshop-Five
Sixth Workshop task for Fine Arts 205 
I skipped ahead to the next workshop as I was having difficulties with the data but will return and fix the problem. I just wanted to makesure it was documented.
I decided to use data from this website and added it to and csv to use whilst I experiment with the functions. -> https://acacia-world.net/default.htm 
I also made an excel with data that I collected from verious websites, with different information on the acacia trees. I wanted to use this for my data self portrait as my name has a lot of history and information on it since it is a tree.
